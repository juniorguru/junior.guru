# AGENTS

- In pytest `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, always include spaces after commas in the argument list, e.g. "secondary_school, university, expected".
- After changes to code or images, always run `uv run jg tidy` before finishing the work.
- Run `uv run jg test` only if you made substantial changes to Python or JavaScript code.
