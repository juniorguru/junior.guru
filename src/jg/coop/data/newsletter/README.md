# Newsletter

Newsletter archive. The `jg sync newsletter-archive` lists published newsletter issues and downloads their data to this directory as JSON files so that they can be further processed, e.g. displayed on website.

The JSON files are kept up-to-date in the CI. Changes are automatically commited back to the repository.
