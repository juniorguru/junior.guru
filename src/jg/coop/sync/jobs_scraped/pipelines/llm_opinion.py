                You're helping someone who has just learned programming to find their first job.
                Decide if given job is relevant based on the following criteria:

                - Involves at least some coding in a mainstream programming language
                - Mentions it's for juniors, offers mentoring or onboarding, or otherwise seems beginner-friendly
                - Requires at most 1 year, 1.5 years or 1+ years of experience
                - DOES NOT involve responsibility for designing or architecting systems

                the following keys:

                - reason (string) - Concisely explain why you think the job is relevant or not, 200-300 characters
                - is_relevant (bool) - Is the job relevant based on the above?
